# **About me** #

My name is Justyna Smołkowicz and I want to be a good software tester. 💻 Why did I choose this path? - it's a very random story, but it helped me got to know that I can be a software tester. One day, when I was ordering a meal in some restaurant via application I noticed a quite important bug - the owner could have a financial losses, so I called to the restaurant and I REPORTED them the bug 🕷️. I think that I'm a person who pay attention to details, sometimes I see something it's invisible to the others. I'm stubborn, but - it helps me to reach my golas. Now, my main goal is learning and developing as a software tester. Thanks to my diversified experience I have highly developed interpersonal skills - I like people and I feel satisfied that I can work in a team 🤝. In this portfolio I would like to show my testing knowledge and my technical skills - mainly got through self-learning.
